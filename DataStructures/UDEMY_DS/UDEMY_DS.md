Time Complexity
Space Complexity

Time Complexity:
----------------
Performance wise
constant time O(1) //More Performance
 > logarithimic Complexity O(logN)
  > Linear Time Complexity O(N)
   > Quadratic Complexity O(N-Pow(2)) 
    > Exponential Complexity O(2-Pow(N)) 
     > Factorial Complexity O(N!) //Worst Performance

***Recurrence Relationship:***
--> Fibbonaci
--> Factorial
--> you define AN in terms of its predecessor AN = A1,A2,A3.....AN-1 .
--> If there is no relation between AN to its predecessor than Recurrence is not possible.
--> the recurrence relation is the base condition, where we can find to end the recurrsion.

Divide and Conquer

## Approach
  Divide the problem into multiple sub-problems
  Conquer the sub-problems and get results
  Combine the results of sub-problems to get final solution

## Identification
  See if you can divide the problem into multiple same-kind-of sub-problems 
  These sub-problems should be solved recursively
  Can results be combined to form a result for the given problem
Examples: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search

### Recurrence Formula
T(n) = aT(n/b) + work done to combine all the results of subproblems
a is the sub-problem of size n/b, where a>=1 and b>1

The composite pattern is used to structure objects in a tree-like hierarchy. Here, each node of the tree can be composed of either child node(s) or be a leaf (no children objects). This pattern allows the client to work with these components uniformly; that is, a single object can be treated exactly how a group of objects is treated.

This pattern allows the formation of deeply nested structures. If a leaf object receives the request sent by the client, it will handle it. However, if the recipient is composed of children, the request is forwarded to the child components.

Both the methods should work the same way.


Chat GPT: 
The Composite pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into a tree-like structure and work with it as if it was a single object.

Composite pattern is useful in situations where a part of your system is composed of simpler elements, and the structure can be nested to any level. In other words, when your objects are containers that can contain both single and multiple objects.

Here are the main components of the Composite Pattern:

Component: This is a base class that can be both a single leaf object or a complex composite object.
Leaf: This class represents the end object, it does not contain any references to other objects.
Composite: This is a container which can store other objects (including other containers).
Its most common use cases include:

Graphics and Scene Graphs: Each composite object (like a group of shapes) can be composed of smaller composite objects (individual shapes), and can be treated uniformly.

Working with Hierarchical Structures: The Composite pattern makes it easier to work with hierarchical structures like file & folder systems. Folders contain files, which can be seen as leaf nodes, or other folders, which can be seen as composite nodes.

Menus: A menu that contains menu items. Those items might be simple items (Leafs) or even other menus (Composite).

The Composite Pattern makes it easier to add new types of elements into your system, promotes flexibility, and simplifies hierarchical structure.

Proxy Pattern : 
Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

an object has an interface with several properties/methods that a client can access. However, an object might not be able to deal with the clientsâ€™ requests alone due to heavy load or constraints such as dependency on a remote source that might cause delays (e.g., network requests). In these situations, adding a proxy helps in dividing the load with the target object.

The proxy object looks exactly like the target object.

const Vs Object.freeze
https://alligator.io/js/const-vs-obj-freeze/#:~:text=comes%20into%20play.-,Object.,existing%20value%20of%20an%20object.&text=const%20makes%20the%20variable%20binding,Object.

const : We CAN change the value/prop of the const object, but we CANNOT re-assign the object
Object.freeze: we CANNOT change the value/prop of the const object, but we CAN re-assign the object

Hence use both of them in conjuction as shown below:

const alligator = {
  canItFly : false
};

Object.freeze(alligator);
alligator.canItFly = true; // This is ignored
alligator = {pi: 3.14}; // This will throw an TypeError
console.log(alligator); // {canItFly: false}

//What will happen in === 
step 1 : both the variables are subjected to typeof(x) , if both of themm are of same type 
step 2: then == is applied on the values 

for math operators null is converted to zero, while undefined is converted to NaN.
+undefined //NaN
+null //0

It’s not recommended to use the question mark operator for blocks of code. The notation is shorter than the
equivalent if statement, which appeals to some programmers. But it is less readable.

A chain of OR "||" returns the first truthy value or the last one if no truthy value is found.
A chain of AND "&&" returns the first falsy value or the last value if none were found.

important difference is that:
|| returns the first truthy value.
?? returns the first defined value.
Ex:
let a = 0  //change a to null and check
let b = 1
let c = a || b
console.log(c)
let d = a ?? b
Console.log(d)

Due to safety reasons, it’s forbidden to use ?? together with && and || operators.

undefined Vs undeclared

let aVariable;
typeof(aVariable) //undefined
typeof(undeclaredVariable) // still undefined, which is wrong in JS , because we havent declared

4. Interface Segregation Principle  (ISP)
The ISP states that a class or component should not be forced to depend on methods it does not use. In React, this means that components should only receive the props they need and not have to rely on unnecessary props.

To apply this principle in React, itâ€™s important to define the exact props a component needs and only pass those props to the component. This ensures that the component only depends on what it needs and not on anything else.

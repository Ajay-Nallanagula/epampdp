Development Mode:

Error Reporting: In development, React provides more detailed error messages and stack traces. This helps developers identify the source of the error and debug more effectively.
Component Tree: React intentionally unmounts the whole component tree below the error boundary and remounts it for a better debugging experience. This makes sure that you get the latest error messages and stack traces.

Production Mode:

Error Reporting: In production, the error messages are less detailed to avoid exposing potentially sensitive information about the internals of your application.
Component Tree: In production, React tries to render as much of the UI as possible, preserving the parts of the component tree that didnâ€™t crash. This behavior provides a better user experience by avoiding a full re-render of the component tree below the error boundary.
